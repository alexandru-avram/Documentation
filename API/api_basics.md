# API Basics

## What is an API

An API defines a set of rules that allow one application to interact with another.
APIs enable:
* Data exchange between applications.
* Automation of tasks.
* Integration of third-party services (e.g., Payment gateways, Weather APIs).

**Analogy**:
Think of an API as a waiter in a restaurant:

* The client (you) orders food.
* The API (waiter) takes your order to the server (kitchen).
* The server prepares the food and sends it back via the API.
