## Numpy

### [Creating NumPp Arrays](https://github.com/alexandruavram-rusu/Documentation/blob/main/Python/04.%20Data%20Science/Numpy%20Library/01.%20Creating%20NumPy%20Arrays.ipynb)
NumPy's arrays are more compact than Python lists -- a list of lists as you describe, in Python, would take at least 20 MB or so, while a NumPy 3D array with single-precision floats in the cells would fit in 4 MB. Access in reading and writing items is also faster with NumPy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**tags**: numpy, numpy arrays, creating numpy arrays, arrange, zeros, ones, linespace, eye, random, rand, randn, randint


### [Numpy Shapes](https://github.com/alexandruavram-rusu/Documentation/blob/main/Python/04.%20Data%20Science/Numpy%20Library/02.%20Shape%20and%20Reshape.ipynb)
Numpy arrays can have two shapes: 1d and 2d.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**tags**: numpy shape, reshape, flatten

### [Indexing and Selection](https://github.com/alexandruavram-rusu/Documentation/blob/main/Python/04.%20Data%20Science/Numpy%20Library/03.%20Indexing%20%26%20Slicing.ipynb)
Numpy arrays can be indexed with other arrays or any other sequence with the exception of tuples.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**tags**: numpy indexing, bracket indexing, broadcasting, fancy indexing, conditional selection

### [Numpy Methods](https://github.com/alexandruavram-rusu/Documentation/blob/main/Python/04.%20Data%20Science/Numpy%20Library/04.%20NumPy%20Methods.ipynb)
As with lists, we are able to use various methods on arrays. We can sort, delete or append items to an array. We can even merge two arrays.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**tags**: numpy methods, append, sort, delete, concatenate

### [Numpy Operations](https://github.com/alexandruavram-rusu/Documentation/blob/main/Python/04.%20Data%20Science/Numpy%20Library/05.%20NumPy%20Operations.ipynb)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**tags**: numpy operations, max, min, argmax, argmin, arithmetic, array functions
