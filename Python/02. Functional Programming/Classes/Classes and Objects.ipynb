    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "*OOP*, as is the abreviation, allows programmers to create their own objects. Objects are individual blocks of code, with methods, attributes and specific properties, functions that use information about the object in order to return results and perform operations. They are very useful in large scripts when functions are just not enough due to the size of the project. Commonly repeated tasks and ojbects can be defined with OOP to create code that is more usable.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP is not specific to Python, but is used in most programing languages.\n",
