## CONTROL FLOW

- [IF-ELSE](#if-else)
- [WHILE](#while)
- [FOR](#for)
- [GOTO](#goto)

### IF-ELSE
Allows for conditional execution of SQL statements.

```
IF condition
BEGIN
  -- Statements to execute if condition is true
END
ELSE
BEGIN
  -- Statements to execute if condition is false
END;
```

### WHILE
Repeats a set of SQL statements as long as the specified condition is true.

WHILE condition
BEGIN
  -- Statements to execute
END;

### FOR
SQL Server doesn't have a native FOR loop like some other languages. Instead, you can use a WHILE loop with a counter.

```
DECLARE @counter INT = 1;

WHILE @counter <= 5
BEGIN
  PRINT 'Iteration: ' + CAST(@counter AS VARCHAR(10));
  SET @counter = @counter + 1;
END;
```

### GOTO
Allows for jumping to a specified label within a batch or stored procedure. RUsing GOTO is generally discouraged as it can make code harder to read and maintain. It's often better to use structured control flow constructs like IF-ELSE or CASE when possible.

```
IF condition
  GOTO label;

-- Statements to execute if condition is false

:label
-- Statements to execute if condition is true
```
