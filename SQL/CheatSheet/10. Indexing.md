## About Indexing

An index in SQL is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. Similar to the index at the back of a book, an SQL index allows the database to find specific rows faster by minimizing the need to scan the entire table for the desired data.

Indexes provide a sorted reference to the rows in a table, which can dramatically enhance the performance of SELECT queries, especially when working with large datasets. However, while indexes speed up read operations, they can also introduce some overhead during write operations (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`).

#### How does an Index Work?

1. **Data Structure**: Most indexes are implemented using a **B-tree** (balanced tree) or a hash table, depending on the database system and the type of index.
   - **B-tree indexes**: These are the most common types of indexes, where data is stored in a balanced tree structure. This allows for fast searching, inserting, and deleting, all in logarithmic time `(O(log n)` complexity). B-trees are used for range queries (e.g., finding records between two values) and queries that require sorted data.
   - **Hash indexes**: These use a hash table to quickly look up data based on equality comparisons (`=`). Hash indexes are fast for exact matches but are not useful for range queries.
2. **Lookup**: When a query is executed, the database engine checks the available indexes to see if one can be used. If an index exists on the column(s) being queried (e.g., in the `WHERE` or `JOIN` clause), the index allows the database to find the relevant rows quickly without scanning the entire table.
3. **Pointers**: Indexes store pointers to the actual rows in the table. These pointers allow the database to quickly locate and retrieve the relevant rows once the index lookup has been performed.
