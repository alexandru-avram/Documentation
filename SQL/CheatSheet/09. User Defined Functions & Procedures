### USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS (UDFs)
A User-Defined Function (UDF) in SQL is a custom function created by the user to encapsulate a specific piece of logic. UDFs take parameters, perform a computation, and return a single value.

```
CREATE FUNCTION CalculateDiscount(price DECIMAL, discount_rate DECIMAL)
RETURNS DECIMAL
BEGIN
  DECLARE discounted_price DECIMAL;
  SET discounted_price = price - (price * discount_rate);
  RETURN discounted_price;
END;
```

### STORED PROCEDURES
A Stored Procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit. Stored Procedures are typically used to encapsulate business logic, perform operations on the database, or execute a series of SQL statements. They can accept parameters, return values, and can be executed by other programs or scripts.

```
CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateEmployeeSalary(employee_id INT, new_salary DECIMAL)
BEGIN
  UPDATE employees
  SET salary = new_salary
  WHERE id = employee_id;
END;
```

### INLINE TABLE-VALUED FUNCTIONS
Similar to UDFs, Inline Table-Valued Functions return a table as a result. They can be used in the FROM clause of a SELECT statement, and their results can be treated like a regular table.

```
CREATE FUNCTION GetEmployeesByDepartment(@dept_id INT)
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN (
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = @dept_id
);
```
