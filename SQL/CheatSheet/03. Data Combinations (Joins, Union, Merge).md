## JOINS

### INNER JOIN
Returns rows that have matching values in both tables.

```
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### LEFT JOIN
Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.

```
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### RIGHT JOIN
Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table.

```
SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### FULL OUTER JOIN
Returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or right table.

```
SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

### CROSS JOIN
Combines each row from the first table with every row from the second table, resulting in a Cartesian product.

```
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

## UNION

The `UNION` operator in SQL is used to combine the results of two or more 'SELECT' queries. 

```
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1 a
[WHERE condition]

UNION

SELECT column1, column2
FROM table2 b
[WHERE condition]
```

### UNION ALL

The `UNION` operator returns distrinct raws by default. To include duplicates, use the `UNION ALL` operator.

```
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1 a
[WHERE condition]

UNION ALL

SELECT column1, column2
FROM table2 b
[WHERE condition]
```

## MERGE

The `MERGE` statement allows the user to perform an `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations into a single statement based on the comparison between a target table and a source table. It's useful for synchronizing two tables or mergin data from one table into another.

```
MERGE INTO target_table AS target
USING source_table AS source
ON target.id = source.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN
  UPDATE SET target.name = source.name, target.age = source.age
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
  INSERT (id, name, age) VALUES (source.id, source.name, source,age);
```
