# Variables

A variable in PL/SQL is a named storage location that temporarily holds a value during program execution. You use variables to store data, manipulate it, and pass it between blocks, procedures, and functions.

## Variable Scope
Scope defines where a variable can be accessed:

Scope	Description	Example
* **Local** : 	Declared inside a block or sub-block,	accessible only in that block
* **Global (in packages)** :	Declared in a package specification, accessible across program units
