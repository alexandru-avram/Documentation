# Variables

A variable in PL/SQL is a named storage location that temporarily holds a value during program execution. You use variables to store data, manipulate it, and pass it between blocks, procedures, and functions.

## Variable Scope
Scope defines where a variable can be accessed:

Scope	Description	Example
* **Local** : 	Declared inside a block or sub-block,	accessible only in that block
* **Global (in packages)** :	Declared in a package specification, accessible across program units

## Naming Rules & Conventions
Variables have a set of rules:
* Must start with a letter
* Can contain only some special characters
* Can be maximum 30 characters
* Are not an Oracle reserved word (example: `select`)

Naming convention:
* **VARIABLE** -> v_varialbe_name
* **CURSOR** -> cur_cursor_name
* **EXCEPTION** -> e_exception_name
* **PROCEDURE** -> p_procedure_name
* **BIND VARIABLE** -> b_bind_name

## Declaring and Initializing
A variable can be declared in the `DECLARE` section of the PL/SQL script.

```
variable_name [CONSTANT] datatype [NOT NULL] [:= DEFAULT value|expression];
```

* variable_name — the name you choose (must follow naming rules)
* [CONSTANT] — determine that the variable will be a constant
* datatype — the type of data it will hold (e.g., NUMBER, VARCHAR2)
* [NOT NULL] — optional constraint to disallow NULLs (requires initialization)
* [DEFAULT value|expression] — optional initial value

Example:
```
DECLARE
  v_text VARCHAR2(50); -- Simple text variable
  v_numb NUMBER(5,2) NOT NULL -- Number varialbe, cannot be null
  v_full_name VARCHAR2(100) NOT NULL := 'John Doe' -- Text variable that has the default value of John Doe
  v_company_name [CONSTANT] VARCHAR2(100) := 'ACME SRL' -- Constant, cannot be changed later
```

You can also assign or modify variable values later inside the BEGIN block.

```
DECLARE
  v_name VARCHAR2(50);
BEGIN
  v_name := 'John Doe'; -- Assigned inside BEGIN
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Name: ' || v_name);
END;
```

If you declare a variable as `NOT NULL`, you must initialize it immediately. Otherwise, Oracle will throw a compilation error: *"PLS-00218: a variable declared NOT NULL must have an initialization assignment"*

```
DECLARE
  v_department VARCHAR2(30) NOT NULL := 'Sales';  -- MUST be initialized
BEGIN
  NULL;
END;
```
