# Sequences

A sequence is a database object that automatically generates unique numeric values in a defined order.Commonly used to:
* Generate primary keys or surrogate keys
* Create transaction IDs, order numbers, etc.
* Ensure unique values across rows, even across sessions

## Creating a Sequence

```
CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name
  START WITH 1
  INCREMENT BY 1
  [MAXVALUE n | NOMAXVALUE]
  [MINVALUE n | NOMINVALUE]
  [CYCLE | NOCYCLE]
  [CACHE n | NOCACHE];
```

Example:

```
CREATE SEQUENCE emp_seq
  START WITH 1000
  INCREMENT BY 1
  NOCACHE
  NOCYCLE;
```

## Sequence Properties

Property | Meaning
|--|--|
START WITH | The first value returned by NEXTVAL
INCREMENT BY | Step value (+ or -)
MAXVALUE | Highest number allowed
MINVALUE | Smallest number allowed
CYCLE | Starts over at MINVALUE or START WITH when MAXVALUE is reached
CACHE | Preallocates values in memory for performance
NOCACHE | Avoids caching (slower but safer if crashes)
